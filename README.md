# Discord Bot - Role Management and Polling

A simple Discord bot built using Python and the `discord.py` library that features role assignment, message censorship, direct messaging, polling, and custom commands.

## Features

- **Role Management**: Assigns and removes a secret role (`Knight`) for users.
- **Polls**: Users can create polls with a custom question.
- **Message Censorship**: The bot deletes messages containing inappropriate words like "shit".
- **Direct Messaging**: Sends direct messages to users based on their input.
- **Replying**: The bot replies to messages when the `!reply` command is used.
- **Permissions**: Certain commands are restricted to users with specific roles (e.g., `!secret` is only accessible to those with the "Knight" role).
